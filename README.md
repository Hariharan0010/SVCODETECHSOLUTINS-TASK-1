### **Library Management System**

#### **Project Overview**
The Library Management System is a simple Java-based application designed to manage the operations of a library. This project allows users to add, update, search, borrow, and return books efficiently. It demonstrates the use of core Java concepts such as classes, objects, and collections.

#### **Features**
- Add new books to the library
- Update existing book details
- Delete books from the system
- Search for books by title, author, or ISBN
- Borrow and return books with status tracking

#### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Java  
- **Core Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap)

#### **Prerequisites**
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans)

#### **Installation and Usage**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the main class:  
   ```java
   javac Main.java  
   java Main  
   ```
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to manage library operations.

#### **File Structure**
- `Main.java` - Entry point of the application.
- `Book.java` - Defines the Book class with attributes and methods.
- `Library.java` - Contains methods for library operations like adding, deleting, and searching books.

#### **Learning Outcomes**
- Improved understanding of Java OOP principles.
- Hands-on experience with Java Collections and file handling.
- Enhanced problem-solving and code-structuring skills.

#### **Future Enhancements**
- Add user authentication for library members.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing.
- Integrate a database for persistent data storage.
